A user can authenticate to a application or a service hosted in a domain (This authentication is done using kerberos authentication protocol). Example of this: User authenticates to a front-end application that servers a back-end database. So now here is the catch, front-end application need to authenticate it self to the back-end server(database). How will that be possible. We have never seen this thing.
So for this situation Unconstrained Delegation was the first solution.
We know that when unconstrained delgation is configured on a computer KDC includes a copy of Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT) inside Ticket Granting Service(TGS).
In the example we are following, when the user authenticates to the front-end application, it extracts the user's TGT from TGS and caches it in memory. Now, when the front-end application needs to access the back-end service, it will use the cached user's TGT to request TGS for the back-end service.
Now we will talk about Unconstrained Delegation attack:
Since the the user's TGT is cached by front-end application, it can use the TGT regardless of which service is being accessed by the user. This is what unconstrained means.
Consider a scenario where domain admin access the front-end application on the machine that uses Kerbeors, their TGT will be cached.
If we can compromise a machine configured with unconstrained delegation, any TGT present in that machines memmory can be extracted and be used to impersonate the user against any other service running in domain. 

This query will return alll the computer that are permitted for unconstrained delegation:
ADSearch.exe --search "(&(objectCategory=computer)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288))" --attributes samaccountname, dnshostname

  <h1>Kerberos Authentication and Unconstrained Delegation</h1>
  <p>
    A user authenticates to an application or service hosted in a domain using the Kerberos authentication protocol. For example, a user authenticates to a front-end application serving a back-end database.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this scenario, the front-end application needs to authenticate itself to the back-end server (database). Unconstrained Delegation was one solution for this situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unconstrained Delegation configures a computer with a copy of the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) inside the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). When the user authenticates to the front-end application, the user's TGT is extracted from TGS and cached in memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequently, when the front-end application needs access to the back-end service, it uses the cached user's TGT to request the TGS for the back-end service.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Unconstrained Delegation poses a security risk. Since the user's TGT is cached by the front-end application, it can use the TGT regardless of which service is being accessed by the user. This vulnerability allows potential exploitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, if a domain admin accesses the front-end application on a machine utilizing Kerberos, their TGT will be cached. If a machine configured with Unconstrained Delegation is compromised, any TGT present in that machine's memory can be extracted and used to impersonate the user against any other service in the domain.
