  <h1>Kerberos Authentication and Unconstrained Delegation</h1>
  <p>
    A user authenticates to an application or service hosted in a domain using the Kerberos authentication protocol. For example, a user authenticates to a front-end application serving a back-end database.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this scenario, the front-end application needs to authenticate itself to the back-end server (database). Unconstrained Delegation was one solution for this situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unconstrained Delegation configures a computer with a copy of the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) inside the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). When the user authenticates to the front-end application, the user's TGT is extracted from TGS and cached in memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequently, when the front-end application needs access to the back-end service, it uses the cached user's TGT to request the TGS for the back-end service.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Unconstrained Delegation poses a security risk. Since the user's TGT is cached by the front-end application, it can use the TGT regardless of which service is being accessed by the user. This vulnerability allows potential exploitation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, if a domain admin accesses the front-end application on a machine utilizing Kerberos, their TGT will be cached. If a machine configured with Unconstrained Delegation is compromised, any TGT present in that machine's memory can be extracted and used to impersonate the user against any other service in the domain.
